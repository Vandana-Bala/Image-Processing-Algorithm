Images are used in a wide range of applications and hence it is necessary to compress the image data for its efficient storage and transmission purposes.  Generally Feedforward Neural Networks
using Back propagation Algorithms are used for image compression due to the ability of ANNs to solve discontinuous and non-linear classification problems. However, here, another compression technique
known as QR Decomposition was implemented and was found that it could be used for a wide range of image compression applications with relatively less complexity in comparison to a complicated
Neural Network.
